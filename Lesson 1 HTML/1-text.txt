Aside: We believe in Giving Back
Because of our love of coffee and people we believe in giving back to the community around us.  A portion of every purchase goes toward planting a tree.  Our trees have been planted all over our community, from schools and senior centers, to public parks, and near road ways.

We believe in you giving to us as we give back to you.  It's a circle of giving... and believing, believing in each other.
