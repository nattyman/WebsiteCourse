    <h4>We believe in Giving Back</h4>
    <p>Because of our love of coffee and people we believe in giving back to the community around us. A portion of every purchase goes toward planting a tree. Our trees have been planted all over our community, from schools and senior centers, to public
      parks, and near road ways.</p>

    <p>We believe in you giving to us as we give back to you. It's a circle of giving... and believing, believing in each other.</p>
