<h1>HTML 5 Best Practices</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Declare a doctype and language</li>
  <li>Stick to lowercase for elements and file names</li>
  <li>Avoid spaces in directories and filenames.  Use a dash "-" instead.</li>
  <li>Use the html, head, and body tags even though you don't have to</li>
  <li>Do not use HTML for formatting, like with the &lt;br&gt; or &amp;nbsp;.  That is what padding and margins in CSS are form.
  <li>Close tags like &less &lt;p&gt; even though you don't have to</li>
  <li>Use semantic elements where they make sense, but don't force it.</li>
  <li>Use double quotes for values, like id=&quot;left-column&quot;, it's just sloppy</li>
  <li>Always use the "alt" atribute for images for screen readers, or incase the image doesn't load.  Plus it's good for SEO</li>
  <li>Use comments where</li>
  <li>Load CSS and JavaScript at the bottom of your file so the main content can load first</li>
  <li>BE CONSISTENT in naming conentions, cassing, dashes or underscores, indentation, etc.</li>
</ul>
